# Introducing Yeoman for Front End Development

This project is the slide deck for the presentation I gave on Dec. 4th, 2012, at [Synacor](http://www.synacor.com/).

This slide deck, was created using [Google IO Slides](http://code.google.com/p/io-2012-slides/), and is an actual Yeoman project itself, which you can find the source for on GitHub: [program247365 / yeoman-presentation] (https://github.com/program247365/yeoman-presentation).

## To get it running:

1. Install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).

2. git clone https://github.com/program247365/yeoman-presentation.git

3. Navigate to root of cloned repo, and run: yeoman server
